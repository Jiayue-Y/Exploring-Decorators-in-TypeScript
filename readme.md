  It was challenging figuring out how to use decorator. I learned more about TS as I go through the coding process. Another challenging thing was that I didn't know how to run the ts program in a ts environment. I kept getting error mistake because I was running the program in a Js environment, even after I installed the ts debugger. Then I realized that I can use the terminal wit ts-node filename.ts to run the ts file in ts environment, which is something that I learned too.
